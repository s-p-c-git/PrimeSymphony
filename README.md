## 🧬 Abstract

This project proposes a novel Structural Stability Theory for the distribution of prime numbers. By modeling the number line as a physical "Cantilever Beam," we identify a specific subsequence of primes ("Limit Orphans") governed by a strict arithmetic tension limit ($\tau \le 1/3$).

Using Control Theory and Laplace Transforms, we demonstrate that this limit acts as a positive damping coefficient, rendering the number line "over-damped" and physically preventing the chaotic resonance required to violate the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 🚀 Key Findings

1. **The 1/3 Safety Valve**: Empirical and analytical proof that local tension is strictly bounded.

2. **Stability Flatline**: The density of Limit Orphans converges to $\approx 0.94$ (Derived from the Twin Prime Constant).

3. **Unconditional Stability**: Laplace analysis places the system poles in the stable Left Half Plane.
